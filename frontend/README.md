# Our principles

We believe in the democratisation of technology: Our system is designed for those who seek to explore and experience the digital world in a simple way.

We value conscious rebellion: We celebrate those who dare to challenge the status quo, those who seek new ways to interact and connect in the digital world.

We promote digital peace of mind: We offer a safe and peaceful space for those who value their privacy and seek control over their digital lives.

We care about the well-being of people and nature: Our system is designed with a focus on the conscious use of resources and respect for our planet.
